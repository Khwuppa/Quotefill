brave Macbeth (well he deserves that name)
So foul and fair a day I have not seen
Look how our partner's rapt
why do I yield to that suggestion / Whose horrid image doth unfix my hair
I have no spur / To prick the sides of my intent, but only / Vaulting ambition which o'erleaps itself
I could not say "Amen" / When they did say "God bless us"
Will all great Neputune's ocean wash this blood / Clean from my hand? No
Macbeth as king
To be thus is nothing, / But to be safely thus
If't be so, / For Banquo's issue have I filed my mind
Thou canst not say I did it. Never shake / Thy gory locks at me
Something wicked this way comes
I bear a charmed life
Macbeth is slain
dead butcher
